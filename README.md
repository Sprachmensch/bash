## BASH
Collection my of script/snippets. [Many of them need **gum** to run!](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
Bash install scripts are getting replaced by ansible scripts and/or python scripts.
And of course these script are build for my system, so don't expect them to run on yours.

#### WHATS ON MY SYSTEM
``` bash
for command in $(ls /usr/bin); do man -f "$command" 2>/dev/null; done >> cmds.txt
```

#### SETUP DOTFILES
``` bash
replaced by ansible :(
```
